# React-Website

## Introduction

A web application built using React.js and React Router that allows users to manage user information. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and editing user details, 
as well as adding new users to the system. The application interacts with a mock API provided by JSONPlaceholder to simulate real data fetching and manipulation operations.
